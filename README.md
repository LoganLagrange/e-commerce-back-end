Clone the repo from github, change the environment variables found in .envEXAMPLE to match your mysql user and password, change the filename to .env. Run the cli command npm i. Log in to mysql and source db/schema.sql.  All packages should now be installed and the program should be ready to run
        
## Usage
        
The program at this  point is only a back end, so it can be running using the command node server.js. You can then test the routes in insomnia or other similar program.
